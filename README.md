# CUDA-NVIDIA_Learning (On Jetson Nano)
Programming Massively Parallel Processors with CUDA-NVIDIA on Jetson Nano Kit
 - Using nvprof tool: 
```
sudo /usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin/nvprof --metrics all ./[name_file_output]
```
 - On target before debugging: 
```
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/nvhost-dbg-gpu
```
  - check its L4T info "JetPack never installs to the Jetson. Only L4T or packages, so there isnâ€™t any JetPack version associated with the Jetson other than possibly the install GUI front end was JetPack of a certain version. On the other hand, so far as I know, there is only one L4T version associated with each JetPack release.":
```
cat /etc/nv_tegra_release
``` 
   - To find a file in a current path:
```
find [path_dictionary_name] -name [file_name]
```
  - To query the properties of the CUDA devices present in the system:
```
cd /usr/local/cuda-10.2/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery
./deviceQuery
```
**Note:** 
 1. Dynamically Linked "Shared Object" Libraries(.so) is found in **/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/** on Jetson Nano. Example this "libcublas.so" library will be linked to compiler with a flag "-lcublas". 
# Lab1 - Hello world

# Lab2 - Matrix Multiplication
  - Run with command (to compile code using cublas library):
  ```
  nvcc matrixMulCUBLAS.cpp -o out -I/usr/local/cuda-10.2/samples/common/inc -I/usr/include/ -lcublas
  ```

# Lab3 - Median Filter
## MyMedianFilter
 - Run with command (to compile codes): 
```
nvcc [all of *.cu or *.cpp] -o [name_file_output] -I/usr/include/opencv4 -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_videoio -Xptxas="-v" 
```
 - You can customize the parameters which include KERNEL_SIZE, NUM_ELEMENTS (= KERNEL_SIZE ^ 2), TILE_SIZE, ITER_NUM, ... in a _Common.hpp_ header file.
1. Example for running code with NotShareMem_Main.cu: 
``` 
nvcc -gencode arch=compute_53,code=sm_53 MedianFilter.cu NotSharedMem_Main.cu ReadingImage.cu -o out -I/usr/include/opencv4 -lopencv_core  -lopencv_imgcodecs
``` 
2. Example for running code with ShareMem_Main.cu:
```
nvcc -gencode arch=compute_53,code=sm_53 MedianFilter.cu SharedMem_Main.cu ReadingImage.cu -o outSharedMem -I/usr/include/opencv4 -lopencv_core  -lopencv_imgcodecs
```
